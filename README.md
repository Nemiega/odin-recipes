Odin recipes website!

Welcome to the Scandinavian Recipes Website! This project aims to provide 
a collection of delicious Scandinavian recipes, showcasing the diverse and 
flavorful cuisine of the Nordic region.

The website is built using HTML and incorporates a brutalist web design 
approach, emphasizing simplicity, raw aesthetics, and functionality. The 
combination of Scandinavian culinary traditions with a bold design 
aesthetic creates a unique and engaging user experience.

By completing this project, I will have demonstrated proficiency in HTML 
and web design principles, particularly in implementing a brutalist design 
style. Additionally, I will have gained a deeper understanding of 
Scandinavian cuisine, its cultural significance, and the process of 
creating a user-friendly recipe website.

Stay tuned as we explore the rich culinary heritage of Scandinavia and 
discover mouthwatering recipes that will bring a taste of the Nordic 
region to your kitchen!
