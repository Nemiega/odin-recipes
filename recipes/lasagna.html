    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>9 lasagna noodles</li>
        <li>450g ground beef</li>
        <li>1 onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>400g crushed tomatoes</li>
        <li>170g tomato paste</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried basil</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon black pepper</li>
        <li>480ml ricotta cheese</li>
        <li>50g grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>15g chopped fresh parsley</li>
        <li>1 egg, beaten</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 190°C. Boil the lasagna noodles according to the package instructions until al dente. Drain and set aside.</li>
        <li>In a large skillet, brown the ground beef over medium heat until fully cooked. Add the chopped onion and minced garlic, and cook for an additional 2-3 minutes until the onion becomes translucent.</li>
        <li>Stir in the crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, dried basil, dried oregano, salt, and black pepper. Simmer the sauce for about 15 minutes to allow the flavors to meld together. Set aside.</li>
        <li>In a separate bowl, combine the ricotta cheese, shredded mozzarella cheese, grated Parmesan cheese, chopped parsley, and beaten egg. Mix well until all the ingredients are evenly incorporated.</li>
        <li>To assemble the lasagna, spread a thin layer of the meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Place 3 lasagna noodles on top of the sauce, slightly overlapping. Spread a layer of the cheese mixture over the noodles, followed by another layer of the meat sauce. Repeat the layers until all the ingredients are used, ending with a layer of meat sauce on top.</li>
        <li>Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil and bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Then, remove the foil and bake for an additional 10-15 minutes, or until the lasagna is hot and bubbly, and the cheese is golden brown.</li>
        <li>Remove the lasagna from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes before slicing and serving. Garnish with additional grated Parmesan cheese and fresh parsley, if desired.</li>
    </ol>
