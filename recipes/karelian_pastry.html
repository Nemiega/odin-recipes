        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a mixing bowl, combine the rye flour, all-purpose flour, and salt for the pastry crust. Gradually add the hot water while mixing until the dough comes together. Knead the dough until smooth and elastic.</li>
            <li>Preheat your oven to 475°F (240°C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
            <li>Divide the dough into small, golf-ball-sized portions. On a floured surface, roll out each dough portion into a thin oval shape, about 1/8-inch thick.</li>
            <li>In a saucepan, combine the short-grain rice, water, and a pinch of salt for the rice porridge filling. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer for about 15-20 minutes or until the rice is cooked and the water is absorbed.</li>
            <li>Stir in the milk and continue cooking over low heat, stirring occasionally, until the mixture thickens and resembles a creamy porridge. Stir in the butter and remove from heat. Let the rice porridge filling cool while you prepare the pastry crust.</li>
            <li>Spoon a generous amount of the cooled rice porridge filling onto the center of each rolled-out dough oval.</li>
            <li>Pinch the edges of the dough to create a thin, raised rim around the rice filling, leaving the center open.</li>
            <li>Place the pastries on the prepared baking sheet and bake in the preheated oven for about 10-15 minutes or until the pastry crust turns lightly golden brown.</li>
            <li>Remove the Karelian Pastries from the oven and let them cool slightly before serving.</li>
        </ol>
