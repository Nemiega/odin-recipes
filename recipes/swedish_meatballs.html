        <li>450g ground beef</li>
        <li>225g ground pork</li>
        <li>50g breadcrumbs</li>
        <li>60ml milk</li>
        <li>40g finely chopped onion</li>
        <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
        <li>0.25 teaspoon ground allspice</li>
        <li>0.25 teaspoon ground nutmeg</li>
        <li>0.5 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>0.25 teaspoon black pepper</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>30g butter</li>
        <li>480ml beef or vegetable broth</li>
        <li>120ml heavy cream</li>
        <li>15ml Worcestershire sauce</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>Fresh parsley, for garnish</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    
    <ol>
        <li>In a large bowl, combine the ground beef, ground pork, breadcrumbs, milk, chopped onion, minced garlic, allspice, nutmeg, salt, black pepper, and egg. Mix well until all the ingredients are evenly incorporated. Shape the mixture into small meatballs, about 2.5cm in diameter.</li>
        <li>In a large skillet, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the meatballs to the skillet and cook until browned on all sides and cooked through, about 8-10 minutes. Remove the meatballs from the skillet and set aside.</li>
        <li>In the same skillet, add the flour and cook for 1-2 minutes, stirring constantly. Gradually whisk in the broth, cream, and Worcestershire sauce, scraping any browned bits from the bottom of the skillet. Continue cooking until the sauce thickens.</li>
        <li>Return the meatballs to the skillet and simmer in the sauce for an additional 5 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld together. Season with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
        <li>Serve the Swedish meatballs hot, garnished with fresh parsley. They are traditionally served with lingonberry sauce and creamy mashed potatoes.</li>
