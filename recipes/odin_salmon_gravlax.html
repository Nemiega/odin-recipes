        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Delicate and elegant, Norwegian salmon gravlax is a traditional Scandinavian delicacy. Fresh salmon fillets are cured with a blend of salt, sugar, citrus zest, and aromatic dill, resulting in a beautifully flavored and silky-textured fish. Sliced thinly, it is a delightful addition to a smorgasbord or served on rye bread or crispbread with mustard sauce, offering a taste of Nordic sophistication.</p>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Rinse the salmon fillet under cold water and pat it dry with paper towels. Place it skin-side down on a clean cutting board.</li>
            <li>In a small bowl, combine the salt, sugar, crushed black peppercorns, lemon zest, and orange zest. Mix well to form a seasoning mixture.</li>
            <li>Rub the seasoning mixture evenly over the flesh side of the salmon fillet, ensuring it is well coated. Sprinkle a generous amount of fresh dill on top.</li>
            <li>Place the salmon in a shallow dish or wrap it tightly in plastic wrap. Refrigerate for at least 24 hours, flipping the salmon halfway through the curing process.</li>
            <li>After 24 hours, remove the salmon from the refrigerator. Rinse off the seasoning mixture and pat the salmon dry with paper towels.</li>
            <li>Using a sharp knife, thinly slice the salmon at an angle, starting from the thicker end of the fillet.</li>
            <li>Serve the Norwegian salmon gravlax on a platter, garnished with additional fresh dill. It is traditionally enjoyed on rye bread or crispbread, accompanied by mustard sauce, cucumber slices, and lemon wedges.</li>
